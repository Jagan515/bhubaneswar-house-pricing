##  Overview

**Bhubaneswar House Price Prediction** is a Flask-based Machine Learning web application that predicts housing prices using a pre-trained model.  
It leverages **Scikit-learn**, **Flask**, and **Docker** to make deployment simple, fast, and portable.

##  Project Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized feature distributions to detect skewedness and outliers
   - Identified strong correlations between features for feature selection
   - Analyzed Bhubaneswar-specific housing patterns

2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
   - Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques
   - Removed outliers using IQR (Interquartile Range) method
   - Normalized data with StandardScaler for consistent feature scaling
   - Addressed capped target variable to prevent bias
   - Created stratified splits for balanced training and testing

3. **Model Development & Cross-Validation**
   - Implemented Linear Regression as baseline model
   - Used K-Fold Cross Validation (5 folds) for robust model evaluation
   - Ensured test data was only used for final evaluation to prevent data leakage
   - Optimized model performance for Bhubaneswar housing market

4. **Model Persistence**
   - Saved the trained pipeline using Pickle for reusability
   - Stored preprocessing scaler for consistent transformations
   - Enabled easy model loading without retraining

5. **Web Application & Deployment**
   - Built user-friendly Flask web interface with range sliders
   - Added input validation to prevent negative predictions
   - Included Bhubaneswar-specific locality information
   - Deployed the model as a Flask app on Render

## Bhubaneswar Housing Features

The model considers these key factors specific to Bhubaneswar:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Locality Rank** | Quality tier of area (Nayapalli, Saheed Nagar, Patia, etc.) |
| **River Proximity** | Near Kuakhai River (premium location) |
| **Crime Rate** | Safety index of the neighborhood |
| **Green Area** | Percentage of parks and green spaces |
| **Industrial Area** | Proximity to industrial zones |
| **Pollution Level** | Air quality index in the area |
| **Employment Distance** | Distance to major IT hubs and offices |

##  Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python 3.13**
- 🧠 **Scikit-learn**
- 🔥 **Flask**
- 🐳 **Docker**
- ☁️ **Render** (for deployment)
- 📊 **Pickle** (for model serialization)

## 🐳 Docker Setup

###  Dockerfile

Here's the Dockerfile used:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements
COPY requirements.txt /app/

# Install dependencies
RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip \
 && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy all files (including .pkl models)
COPY . /app

# Expose Render-assigned port
EXPOSE $PORT

# Start app with Gunicorn
CMD ["gunicorn", "app:app", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:$PORT", "--workers", "3"]
```

##  Build and Run Docker Image Locally

### **Step 1:** Build the image

```bash
docker build -t jagan515/pencil .
```

### **Step 2:** Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 8888:5000 jagan515/pencil
```

### **Step 3:** Open the app

Visit [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) in your browser.

## 🔍 Detailed Docker Command Explanation

### **`docker build -t jagan515/pencil .` - Breaking it down:**

- **`docker`** - The Docker command-line interface program
- **`build`** - The subcommand to build a new image from a Dockerfile
- **`-t jagan515/pencil`** - The `-t` flag tags your image with a name
  - **`jagan515`** - Your Docker Hub username (for pushing to registry)
  - **`pencil`** - The name of your application
  - **`/`** - Separates username from repository name
  - This creates a local image named `jagan515/pencil:latest` (latest is default tag)
- **`.`** - The build context (current directory)
  - Docker looks for a `Dockerfile` in this directory
  - All files in this directory are sent to Docker daemon (use `.dockerignore` to exclude files)

### **`docker run -p 8888:5000 jagan515/pencil` - Breaking it down:**

- **`docker`** - Docker CLI program
- **`run`** - Creates and starts a new container from an image
- **`-p 8888:5000`** - Port mapping flag (`-p` = publish)
  - **`8888`** - Host machine port (your computer)
  - **`5000`** - Container internal port (where your Flask app runs)
  - Format: `host_port:container_port`
  - This maps port 5000 inside container to port 8888 on your machine
- **`jagan515/pencil`** - The image name to run
  - Docker looks for this image locally first, then on Docker Hub if not found

### **What happens when you run these commands:**

1. **Build Process:**
   - Docker reads `Dockerfile` in current directory
   - Creates layers for each instruction in Dockerfile
   - Installs Python, dependencies, copies your code
   - Creates a final image tagged as `jagan515/pencil`

2. **Run Process:**
   - Docker creates a container from your image
   - Sets up isolated environment with your app
   - Maps network ports so you can access the app
   - Starts the Flask app with Gunicorn server
   - Your app is now running in an isolated container

##  Common Docker Commands Explained

| Command | Breakdown | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **`docker ps`** | `docker` + `process status` | Shows all running containers |
| **`docker images`** | `docker` + `images` | Lists all Docker images on your system |
| **`docker stop <id>`** | `docker` + `stop` + `container_id` | Gracefully stops a running container |
| **`docker rm <id>`** | `docker` + `remove` + `container_id` | Deletes a stopped container |
| **`docker rmi <image>`** | `docker` + `remove image` + `image_name` | Deletes a Docker image from system |
| **`docker logs <id>`** | `docker` + `logs` + `container_id` | Shows console output from container |
| **`docker exec -it <id> bash`** | `execute` + `interactive terminal` | Opens bash shell inside running container |

##  Deploying to Render

1. Push your project (with `Dockerfile`) to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repo to [Render.com](https://render.com)
3. Choose **"Docker"** as the deployment environment
4. Render automatically builds and runs your Docker image

### Deployment Steps:
